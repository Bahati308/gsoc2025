Some projects are assignments. Others are adventures. My Google Summer of Code journey was the latter—a deep dive into real-world problem-solving, open-source collaboration, and shipping features that actually matter.

Over the course of GSoC, I worked on Improving E2E QA Tests—an initiative to boost test coverage for our new React frontend from roughly 30% to over 80%. The mission was clear: close testing gaps, validate the entire application workflow, and integrate robust test suites into the CI/CD pipeline. This wasn’t just about adding tests—it was about building confidence in every deploy, protecting critical user flows, and elevating system reliability to production-grade standards.

What follows is not just a technical log, but the story of how an idea went from proposal to production—complete with hurdles, breakthroughs, and lessons that will outlast the program itself.
