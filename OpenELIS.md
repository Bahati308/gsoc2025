Introduction
The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is more than just a coding program—it’s a global stage where developers, contributors, and open-source communities unite to solve real-world problems. This year, my GSoC journey focused on Improving E2E QA tests, a project aimed at strengthening and streamlining E2E Tests.

Through this initiative, I collaborated closely with experienced mentors, navigated complex technical challenges, and contributed meaningful improvements to an open-source codebase used by developers worldwide. Beyond code, GSoC offered a crash course in problem-solving at scale, open-source best practices, and the discipline needed to turn ambitious ideas into production-ready results.

This report captures the journey—from initial planning to implementation and testing—highlighting the technical achievements, lessons learned, and the lasting impact of this work on the project and the broader community.
